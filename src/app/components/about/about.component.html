                        So what can I say other than I love programming! I have made this portfolio to
                        showcase my skills in Frontend development and some small glimpse of some
                        DevOps work!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a whole page dedicated to projects that I have worked on, although not
                        very long at the moment, it is ever growing! I have started building my own
                        apps and websites and releasing them under the name
                        <span class="techyBoy">techyBoy</span>.
                        
                        I'm not much of a designer, but my skills lie in other areas, such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <!-- Change to something like chips, or ticks or something other than normal bullet points -->
                        <li *ngFor="let skill of skillList" value="skill">{{skill}}</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To see more of what I can do checkout out my projects!
